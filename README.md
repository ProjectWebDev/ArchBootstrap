# ArchBootstrap

This is a space for me to host scripts that I can use to quickly set up a working installation of Arch Linux.


setup.sh (the latest addition to this repo) combines and improves upon the functionality of bootstrap.sh and chroot.sh.
For historical purposes, these files will continue to exist in this repo, but they are severely flawed and shouldn't be run with the expectation of a flawless and bug-free experience.



btw, i use arch
